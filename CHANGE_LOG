Todo:
  1) Multiple token support for modules
  2) Update webadmin w/ changes to program structure
  3) Finalize migration to mod_ctrl system.

version 1.5 September 1 st, 2001
1.	php_egg.sql
	a. Conformed later entries in the "module_name" column in modules to the pattern of the first
		Ex: "msg help module" -> "msg_help"
	   Under this system, a module's php code will be stored in it's $module_name variable,
	   through the new, dynamic mod_ctrl.php architecture.
	   The only modification that may be necessary is to MAKE SURE the modules' names (module_name) and $modulevars
	   are syncronized! IE if function m is called functionm in connect.inc and "function m" in MySQL, function m
	   will not work.
	b. Added "token" field to modules...if your module deals w/ looking for tokens (Ex: ?help, !command, @find),
	   insert it's token here and then mod_ctrl will take care of the rest =)
	b. Deleted user entries that hampered me from setting up my initial user account

2.	mod_ctrl.php
	A redisgn of the entire module loading architecture.  Allows an admin to un/load all modules
	set to autoload, un/load absolutely all modules (even non-autoload), un/load a specific module.

3.	msgcommands.mdl
	a.  Added the following functions:
	join, nick, part, op2, v2, reload, unload, load
	Ex:	/msg <botnick> nick <password> <desirednick>
		/msg <botnick> [un|re]load <password> All
		/msg <botnick> [un|re]load <password> <module name>
	Note: I added the op2 and v2 because there seem to be other versions floating around..so this is just
	to make sure i don't break code elsewhere =)	

	b.  deliver_token() Tentative structural change...meant to dynamically load modules "on the fly" when ever they are needed...
	Then they can be unloaded after 30min or so of non-usuage (To be added).  Should not conflict w/ "traditional"
	eval'ing mods in connect.inc.  No longer must u add separate if statements in connect.inc to parse tokens!
