MODE - occurs when a mode is changed example: --- Talia gives voice to php_Egg

When you create a new module you will need to know what bind to attache your module to. The more binds you add your module to the more times it gets run dont create a module that should be bound to everthing that is a waste of power and can cause the bot to lag. only bind it where it needs to be bound.

How to make a module.

There is only one major rewl with regard to creating new modules for PHP-Egg You may NOT have any functions in your module file.  it must be pure php code with no <?php or ?> php tags for starting and ending the php.  All modules are run using eval so putting start and end php tags in will cause you to get errors.

If you need any functions you can create your own functions place you new function in common.inc and it will be included when the bot starts.

things to help you.

Depending apon the type of module bind you decided to use you will get difrent data. in most cases you will get the folowing varables.

$who  this is the person that sent the message in the folowing format nick!ident@hostmask
I have created a function for making it easer to use these. 

example.

$who=$command_data[0];
$sender_info=clean_nick($who);  // clean_nick is the function to clean out the nick.
$sender_nick=$sender_info[0];
$sender_ident=$sender_info[1];
$sender_host=$sender_info[2];


If it is in a channel you will also get $chan

what ever the person sent comes in as $message rember to trim this becouse in most cases it will contain some traling (\n\r) data from the server.


Notes about nicks and mysql.  There is a problem with inserting and compairing nicks. You need to becareful about people with speical charaters in there nick such as \`'  these can fail in the insert into mysql and chan fail checks to mysql rember to addslashes if you have a problem.


once your module is done and has been added to a module bind in the web admin section all you need to do is reload the modules in PHP-Egg

/msg <bot> !reload <yourpass>



We will be putting up a site where you can post your modules soon.
